# Acoustic Triangulation System
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Acoustic Triangulation System project! This project aims to design and implement an acoustic localization system using time difference of arrival (TDoA) to accurately determine the position of a sound source within a defined grid.
## Project Overview
Collaborative work to design and develop an acoustic triangulation system using two Raspberry Pi Zero's and 4 MEMS microphones. The system calculates two-dimensional coordinates of the sound source within the grid and displays the results through a graphical user interface.
